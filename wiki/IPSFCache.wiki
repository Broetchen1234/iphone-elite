= Overview =

IPSF users can probably recover their original seczone token value before IPSF zeroed it out.

= Details =

*IPSF users should do the following*

  * Log into your iphone and type: `cp $(find /var/root/Library/Caches/bbsimfree -name "*.cache") /ipsf.cache`
  * Copy that cache off of your iPhone and save it!  It contains very valuable data.
