#summary How iPhoneSIMFree works.

=How IPSF works=
_This was originally posted, then deleted from The iPhone Dev Wiki as spam._

==The following things were observed by Zibri and/or others:==
- IPSF does not make a patch or otherwise change things in baseband firmware, except temporarily to put their unlock patch in the NVRAM.

- Some parts of the IPSF software are not necessary steps to their unlock, maybe just obfuscation and distraction for those trying to reverse-engineer.

- When their application is run a small chunk of NVRAM is extracted from the device and uploaded to the IPSF server.  This packet is sent to backoffice.iphonesimfree.com.

- The packet is sent back modified after being modified where the LOCK is saved.

- A custom baseband bootblock is used to flash the 'unlock' patch to NVRAM.

- Then they overwrite the baseband with the original firmware again.

<ebika> gopi: ipsf may gen real codes, or it may write the results as if real codes were gen'd
<Zibri> ebika: the second thing you said is correct.

<Lurker\> Zibri: if you find time, update the wiki with your findings, would surly help a lot of people
<Zibri> those data are the "proof" of the unlock. i mean. grey's patch is flawed because it writes a flag (unloc
<Zibri> so the nvram corrupts. and then .. bye bye imei :)
<Zibri> lurker: no time. no joy in doing it.
<Zibri> if you want cut & paste my words to the wiki :)
 
<w___> what they do is inject intermediate values into the hash

<w___> the sw u run on the iphone installs a fake bb

<w___> your nck gets verified as good
<w___> it unlocks the simlock (rewrites the simlock area)
<w___> it then puts your bb back to how it was
