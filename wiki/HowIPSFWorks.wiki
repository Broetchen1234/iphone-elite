#summary How iPhoneSIMFree works.

=How IPSF works=
_This was originally posted, then deleted, from The iPhone Dev Wiki...as spam._

==The following things were observed by Zibri and/or others:==
- IPSF does not make a patch or otherwise change things in baseband firmware, except temporarily to put their unlock patch in the NVRAM.

- When their application is run a small chunk of NVRAM is extracted from the device and uploaded to the IPSF server.  This packet is sent to backoffice.iphonesimfree.com.

- The packet is sent back after being modified where the LOCK is saved.

- A custom baseband bootblock is used to flash the 'unlock' patch to NVRAM.

- Then they overwrite the baseband with the original firmware again.
