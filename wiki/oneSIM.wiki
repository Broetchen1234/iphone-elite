= What is oneSIM ? =

oneSIM is a patched anySIM version.

oneSIM patches the bytes that anySIM patches, back to normal :)

it's only for developers, researchers, and testers.

Just a useful tool to fastly patch back and do tests.

oneSIM 1.1 patches back ONLY iPhones patched with anySIM 1.1.

It has nothing to do with the upcoming 'virginator'.


= Notes =

I found a problem in anySIM:

If you want to unlock (anySIM 1.1) and relock (oneSIM 1.1), don't use the normal anySIM 

1.1 version: they forgot to eliminate the command "AT+CLCK="PN",0,"00000000" which was 

needed by the *previous* patch. Issuing that command, anySIM make the counter go *up* by

1 everytime you run it.

To patch it, take an HEX editor and search for the command above.

Substitute it with ATZ (followed by 0x0D and 0x00).

That's all folks!
