#How to downgrade from 1.1.2 to 1.0.2.

= Instructions =

GO TO DFU MODE
(power+home for 10 seconds then home for 10 seconds)
Phone will remain completely BLACK.
If not repeat previous step.

Then select 1.0.2 firmware for restoring.

At the end you will have an error.

THAT's NORMAL!

Now get IPHUC and issue:

*cmd setenv auto-boot true*

*cmd saveenv*

*cmd fsboot*

You just downgraded!

You also can, after jailbreaking 1.0.2, issue these commands:

*cd /var/root/Media*

*mknod disk c 14 1*

*chmod 666 disk*

and then UPDATE to 1.1.2 directly.
