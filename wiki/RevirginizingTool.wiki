#summary Using the re-virginizing tool

= Introduction =

This tool is designed to rebuild your lock table in the seczone area and repair the damage done by the original anySIM unlock.  It in essence re-virginizes your phone. 

To answer some questions:

Yes, it does clear the NCK counter

Yes, it does obsolete the IPSF + server method.  The entire process is done on your phone in the baseband.

= Details =

Before running this, it would be very advisable to backup your seczone flash page, just in case anything goes wrong.

To do this, grab a copy of 'norz' and run the following on the phone:

# norz seczone.backup 0x3FA000 0x2000 (sorry, there was a mistake here earlier -- we're tired)

You should see:
