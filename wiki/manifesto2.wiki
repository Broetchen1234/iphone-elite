{{{
<+geohot> currently there are three patches on the "market"
<+geohot> old anysim, new anysim, and ipsf
<+geohot> old anysim patches out the token check
<+geohot> so the lockstate table was updated but not the token
<+geohot> while the patch was present this was fine
<+geohot> but once the patch got removed, the phone failed the integrity check
<+geohot> hence, bad imei and xlock 2
<+geohot> ipsf patches the seczone server side
<+geohot> they get your tea key so they can de/en crypt lockstate tables for your phone
<+geohot> they also found a bug in the implementation of rsa
<+geohot> this is what enables them to generate the tokens
<+geohot> so...new lockstate+new token="real" unlocked phone
<+geohot> the third, new anysim
<+geohot> technically this isn't an unlock, but it is the best option, for reasons i will explain later
<+geohot> it patches out the mnc check, disabling the network check allowing anysim to be used :)
<+geohot> zibri is trying to patch more integrity checks to allow 1.1.1 to read old anysim corrupted data
<+geohot> this will work, but it is a hack
<+geohot> due to the symmetric nature of tea, regenerating the seczone to virgin from old anysim can be done
<+geohot> and i can do it, this loader is just a bitch
<+geohot> now, onto ipsf
<+geohot> ipsf unlocks *cannot* be reversed
<+geohot> unless you have a backup
<+geohot> this is because ipsf changes the tokens, which cannot be regened
<+geohot> i really hope ipsf keeps backups of utokens, because here is what i think will happen...
<+geohot> when the bootloader is updated(it hasn't been yet), all ipsf phones will become bricks
<+geohot> because they will fix the exploit in the rsa
<+geohot> the best option now is the new anysim
<+geohot> it doesn't touch the seczone, so your phone will never be bricked
<+geohot> although it isn't restore/upgrade resistent
<+geohot> **end rant**
