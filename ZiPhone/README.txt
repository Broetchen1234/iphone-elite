Ziphone version 2.1

Updated:

No need to set Verbose mode (its default)

To use installer you must firstly install the "BSD Subsystem" package

Usage

Ziphone -j  = Jailbreak
Ziphone -a = Activate
Ziphone -u = Unlock (Works on both BL3.9 and BL4.6)
Ziphone -e = Erase Baseband (BL 3.9 only)
Ziphone -b = Downgrade Bootloader from 4.6 to 3.9, update baseband to 4.03.13 and patch the unlock.

*** only use -b if your iphone is 1.1.2/1.1.3 OOB ***

It is also possible to combine the functions e.g ziphone -a -j -u

*Added Windows batch files for n00bs*

ClickHereX3.9.bat Will call Ziphone -u -j -a (use with iphones that were < 1.1.1 OOB)

ClickHereX4.6.bat will call Ziphone -b -j -a (Downgrades bootloader be warned, use for iphone > 1.1.2)

Jailbreak will work on any OS version.

Activation will work on any OS version, except for youtube on 1.0.X (I am lazy i know)

Details on how it works and WHY it works are available on http://www.iphone-elite.org

believed in free software. (Thanks for the toolchain!)
